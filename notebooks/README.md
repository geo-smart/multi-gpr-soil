# The files I have worked on.

### 3.1: Appying a scikit learn GPC model to the data.
####   I got this to run, but the output is all sand.
### 4.1: Me trying to add dask to pytorch in training the model.
####   This does not have much working.
### 5-dask: This is a notebook where I've added dask to the hyperparameter tuning side of things.
####   This is somewhat working, but I hit storage limitations so I was not able to fully test it.
